\begin{abstract}

Timing variations in pulsars, low frequency ubiquitous structure
known as timing noise and sudden increases in frequency which we
call glitches, provide a means to study neutron stars. Since the first
observations were made of these phenomena, many models have been proposed to
explain them, yet no definitive explanation has arisen. In particular timing
noise, perhaps due to the variety of phenomena it pertains too, lacks any
universal description.

In this thesis, we aim to improve this situation by developing models of timing
noise, we focus chiefly on precession models which explain periodic modulation.
Developing such models is important as it provides an opportunity to infer the
elemental properties of neutron stars: evidence for long period precession has
implications for the superfluid component predicted by models which are used to
explain the occurrence of glitches. However, often more than one model can
qualitatively explain the data, therefore we need a method to decide which
model best fits the data. This is precisely the case for one particular pulsar, 
PSR~B1828-11. This pulsar is used as evidence for both precession
and so-called magnetospheric switching. We address this confusion by applying the tools of
probability theory to develop a Bayesian model comparison and
find that evidence in favour of precession.

Our knowledge of neutron stars is exclusively derived from our electromagnetic
observations. In the future we may detect gravitational waves from neutron
stars. To do this, we often use matched filtering methods which search for the
signal using a template, a guess for what the signal `looks like'. Timing
variations, as seen in the electromagnetic signal, may also exist in the
gravitational wave signal. If detected these could provide an invaluable source
of information about neutron stars. However, if not included in the template,
they may mean that the signal is not detected in the first place. We
investigate this issue for both timing noise and glitches, using
electromagnetic observations to predict for what types of searches this may be
an issue. We find that while timing noise is unlikely to be an issue for current
searches, glitches may cause a significant problem for all-sky searches
for gravitational waves from neutron stars.
