Continuous gravitational waves may be emitted from a variety of sources and
often different sources require different types of searches.  Already we have
discussed the search for GWs from an isolated neutron star which emits due to a
'mountain' in its crust. In addition to these searches, efforts are made to
detect CWs from LMXBs \citep{ligo2015scox1} and supernova remnants
\citep{LIGO_SNR2015}. All of these searches (except some targetted searches)
assume the GW signal is smooth, either as a smooth spin-down Taylor expansion,
or in the case of LMXBs a constant frequency signal. However, timing-variations
may violate this assumption and lead to a loss of SNR in the detection process.
In Chapter.~\ref{sec; timing noise in cgw} we used a realisation of
timing-noise from the Crab to estimate the effect of timing noise in
fully-coherent searches. In this chapter, we will calculate the mismatch
analytically for some models of timing noise. We will do this using the
generalised metric mismatch defined in Sec.~\ref{sec: generalising the
metric-mismatch}. Already we have used this technique to calculate the mismatch
due to glitches in Sec.~\eqref{eqn: mismatch due to glitches}, now we will
apply to it random walk models and manetospheric switching. While the latter of
these is quite specific, random walk models may be used to estimate the
mismatch in a variety of systems.

\section{Random walk models}
\label{sec: random walk models}

In Sec.~\ref{sec: TN interpretations random walk models} we described the
random walk model for timing noise. Recent observations \citep{Hobbs2010}
suggest that such a description does not capture the physics of timing noise
in isolated radio pulsars and hence is not a useful way to infer neutron star
physics. However, empirically the timing residuals of many pulsars are indistinct
from a random walk, so while it cannot help with inference, it is a useful
description if we only need to know what timing noise `looks like'. With this
in mind, in this section we consider a simplistic random walk model of timing noise.
Moreover, this can also be applied to searches for GWs from LMXBs where
fluctuations in the spin-down torque may cause a random walk around some fixed
frequency.

To calculate the mismatch, we will model the random walk as a zero-mean
gaussian walk in the phase, frequency, and spin-down which occurs at $N$ fixed
time intervals, $\Delta T$. Choosing fixed time intervals appears to introduce
an additional timescale not usually present in random walk models. However, as
discussed in section \ref{sec: physical interpretation of the monthly
ephemeris} this is consistent with a large number of unresolved events which
are measured over a fixed time scale. We therefore expect the fixed timescale
to drop out when we write results in terms of the unresolved events.
