It's unclear at this time what causes timing noise, but from Chapter.~\ref{sec:
timing noise in cgw} we know that it may pose a problem for continuous GW
searches if the phase evolution is effected by timing noise and that is not
included in the search templates. In addition to searches for isolated neutron
stars, searches for GWs from low-mass X-ray binary systems (LMXBs) may
experience similar difficulties due to stronger form of timing noise known as
`spin-wandering', which constrains the maximal coherence time to the order of a
few days before it would lead to a complete loss of SNR, thereby limiting the
best achievable sensitivity \citep[see][for
details]{ligo2015scox1,leaci2015,ScoX1:MDC1}.

Ideally, we would like to be able to predict when searches are at risk to
timing noise.  We have already done this in Chapter.~\ref{sec: timing noise in
cgw} by using an empirical description of timing noise from the Crab pulsar.
However, this is limiting as the way timing noise manifests varies between
sources. An alternative method is to model timing noise, predict the form of
the continuous GW signal and then calculate the mismatch. In this chapter, we
will do this for the random walk model of timing noise as described in
Section~\ref{sec: TN interpretations random walk models}.  Recent observations
\citep{Hobbs2010} suggest that such a description does not capture the physics
of timing noise in isolated radio pulsars and hence is not a useful way to
infer neutron star physics. Nevertheless, empirically the timing residuals of
many pulsars are indistinct from a random walk, so while it cannot help with
inference, it is a useful description if we only need to know what timing noise
`looks like'. Moreover, the random walk model can also be applied to LMXBs
where the amount of spin-wandering could be inferred from fluctuations in the
luminosity. We will not apply the model to make such predictions in this
chapter, but we will calculate the mismatch given the random walk model.

\section{Conclusion}

In this section, we have calculated the expectation of the fully-coherent
mismatch when searching for a GW signal which undergoes a random walk in one of
the phase, frequency, or spin-down rate. We did this initially for an
unminimised system and then minimised with respect to the template parameters
$f_\textrm{t}$ and $\dot{f}_\textrm{t}$. In the future, we would like to develop
this work to make direct predictions for GW searches. For example,
searches for GWs from LMXBs assume a constant frequency, but torque fluctuations
could produce a random walk in the frequency; we could model this and, given
an estimate for the random walk parameters, estimate for what observation span
GW searches may be at risk of loosing the signal.

Another observation which we would like to understand further is the
implication of the power-law dependence on the observation time. In particular,
in Eqn.~\eqref{eqn: Expected mismatch RW in frequency k2} we found that for
a random walk in the frequency
$E[\mutilde] \propto \Tobs ^{3}$ while in Chapter.~\ref{sec: timing noise in
cgw} we found that the expected fully-coherent mismatch for timing noise as
described by the Crab ephemeris scales as $\propto \Tobs^{2.88\pm-0.03}$ (see
Eqn.~\eqref{eqn: fit values}). This suggests that the data in Crab ephemeris
may be consistent with a random walk in the frequency (something that was
first noted by \citet{Boynton1972}), but requires further investigation to
establish this.
