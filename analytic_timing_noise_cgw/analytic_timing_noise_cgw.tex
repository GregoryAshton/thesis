Continuous gravitational waves may be emitted from a variety of sources and
often different sources require different types of searches.  Already we have
discussed the search for GWs from an isolated neutron star which emits due to a
'mountain' in its crust. In addition to these searches, efforts are made to
detect CWs from LMXBs \citep{ligo2015scox1} and supernova remnants
\citep{ligo_SNR2015}. All of these searches (except some targetted searches)
assume the GW signal is smooth, either as a smooth spin-down Taylor expansion,
or in the case of LMXBs a constant frequency signal. However, timing-variations
may violate this assumption and lead to a loss of SNR in the detection process.
In Chapter.~\ref{sec: timing noise in cgw} we used a realisation of
timing-noise from the Crab to estimate the effect of timing noise in
fully-coherent searches. In this chapter, we will calculate the fully-coherent mismatch
analytically for random walk models of timing noise. We will do this using the
generalised metric mismatch defined in Sec.~\ref{sec: generalising the
metric-mismatch}. Already we have used this technique to calculate the mismatch
due to glitches in Sec.~\eqref{sec: mismatch due to glitches}. 

In Sec.~\ref{sec: TN interpretations random walk models} we described the
random walk model for timing noise. Recent observations \citep{Hobbs2010}
suggest that such a description does not capture the physics of timing noise in
isolated radio pulsars and hence is not a useful way to infer neutron star
physics. However, empirically the timing residuals of many pulsars are
indistinct from a random walk, so while it cannot help with inference, it is a
useful description if we only need to know what timing noise `looks like'. With
this in mind, in this section we consider a simplistic random walk model of
timing noise. This can be applied to searches for GWs from isolated neutron
stars, but also to to searches for GWs from LMXBs where fluctuations in the
spin-down torque may cause a random walk around some fixed frequency.

To calculate the fully-coherent mismatch, we will model the random walk as a zero-mean
gaussian walk in the phase, frequency, and spin-down which occurs at $N$ fixed
time intervals, $\Delta T$. Choosing fixed time intervals appears to introduce
an additional timescale not usually present in random walk models. However, as
discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec: physical interpretation of the monthly
ephemeris} this is consistent with a large number of unresolved events which
are measured over a fixed time scale.

\section{Conclusion}

In this section, we have calculated the expectation of the fully-coherent
mismatch when searching for a GW signal which undergoes a random walk in one of
the phase, frequency, or spin-down rate. We did this initially for an
unminimised system and then minimised with respect to the template parameters
$f_\textrm{t}$ and $\dot{f}_\textrm{t}$. In the future we would like to develop
these predictions further to make direct predictions for GW searches. For example,
searches for GWs from LMXBs assume a constant frequency, but torque fluctuations
could produce a random walk in the frequency; we could model this and, given
an estimate for the random walk parameters, estimate for what observation span
GW searches may be at risk of loosing the signal.

Another observation which we would like to understand further is the
implication of the power-law dependence on the observation time. In particular,
in Eqn.~\eqref{eqn: Expected mismatch RW in frequency k2} we found that for
a random walk in the frequency
$E[\mutilde] \propto \Tobs ^{3}$ while in Chapter.~\ref{sec: timing noise in
cgw} we found that the expected fully-coherent mismatch for timing noise as
described by the Crab ephemeris scales as $\propto \Tobs^{2.88\pm-0.03}$ (see
Eqn.~\eqref{eqn: fit values}). This suggests that the data in Crab ephemeris
may be consistent with a random walk in the frequency (something that was
first noted by \citet{Boynton1972}), but requires further investigation to
establish this.
