In this section we use the generalised fully-coherent metric mismatch approximate
to calculate the analytic mismatch for a variety of timing-noise models.

\section{Random walk models}
\label{sec: random walk models}

Here  we consider a simplistic model of timing noise in which the phase,
frequency, and spin-down perform a random walk at fixed time intervals over N
steps. Choosing fixed time intervals appears to introduce an additional
timescale not usually present in random walk models. However, as discussed in
section \ref{sec: physical interpretation of the monthly ephemeris} this is
consistent with a large number of unresolved events which are measured over a
fixed time scale. We therefore expect the fixed timescale to drop out when we
write results in terms of the unresolved events.  While random walk models are
not considered to be an accurate description of timing noise over long time
scales, over typical CW search time scales they may provide a reasonable
approximation.
